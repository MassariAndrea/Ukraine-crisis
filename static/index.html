                    Four people were confirmed to have died in the UK and Ireland by <br> Friday evening. The Met Office said a wind speed of up to 122mph <br> was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Friday, <br> provisionally the highest ever in England, and described the <br> storm as the worst since the Burn’s Day storm 32 years ago in <br> which 47 people died. <br><br>    
                    
                    About a third of the UK population – about 20 million people – <br> were told to stay at home as the Met Office imposed two rare red <br> warnings for much of southern England, south Wales and London. <br><br>
                    
                    The disruption closed thousands of schools and businesses.<br> About 435,000 homes were left without power early on Friday evening.<br> Hundreds of train services and flights were cancelled, and major <br> roads closed.</p></div>
